This project is about using machine learning to predict whether an asteroid is hazardous or not based on its orbital and physical parameters. I used two different models to compare their performance and accuracy. The first model is built using the `sklearn` library, which provides various tools and algorithms for machine learning tasks(logistic regression in this case). The second model is built from absolute scratch using only `numpy`, which is a library for scientific computing in Python. 

I wanted to challenge myself and learn how to implement a machine learning model from the ground up without relying on any external frameworks. The data for this project comes from the NASA Near Earth Object (NEO) API, which provides information about asteroids and comets that are close to Earth. I used `pandas` to load and preprocess the data, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the data, and `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate the models. 

The code for this project is available on GitHub and can be run on any Python environment that has the required libraries installed.
